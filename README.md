## During the Internship, I worked on the following Projects:  
  
  - **Cats and Dogs Image Classification -** Classified **Images of Cats** and **Dogs** using **SVM** regression ML model from **Kaggle** dataset with the help of **Matplotlib**, **Keras**, **TensorFlow**, and others.
  
  - **Hand Gesture Detection -** Developed **Hand Gesture Recognition Model** that can **Identify** and **Classify** different **Hand Gestures** from **Image** or **Video** data, enabling intuitive **Human-Computer Interaction** and **Gesture-based Control** Systems with the help of **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Sklearn**, **Keras**, and others.

  - **House Price Prediction -** Predicted **Price of the House** using **Linear** regression ML model based on their **Square Footage** and the number of **Bedrooms** and **Bathrooms** with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Sklearn**, and others.
  
  - **Online Retail Customer Segmentation -** Created **K-means Clustering** algorithm using **Elbow** method to **Group Customers** of a **Retail Store** based on their **Purchase** history with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Sklearn**, and others.
